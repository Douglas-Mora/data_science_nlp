 - *Normal distribution*. Might be considered 'bell-shaped' or 'hill-shaped'. It's very common.
 - *Mean*. Also called the *Average*, describes the center of a numeric distribution by adding all values and dividing by the count.
 - *Standard deviation*. Describe the spread of values in a numeric distribution relative to the *mean*. It is calculated by finding the average squared distance from each data point to the mean and square-rooting the result.
 - *Median*. Middle value when all values are arranged form smallest to largest.
 - *Quartile*. It's a marker for a quarter (25%) of the data.
 - *Interquartile range (IQR)*. Is the difference between Q3 and Q1, marking the data for just the middle 50% of the data.
- *Outliers*. Extreme values that are distant from the rest of the distribution. Outliers tend to more heavily influence the *mean* than the *median*.

Because the *median* and *IQR* are not heavily influenced by extreme values, we say the are **robust**.
Robust statistics are often a better choice to measure the center and spread of a distribution that is skewed of has outliers.

- *Mode*. The value with the highest frequency, or the value where the peak of the distribution occurs. There could be more than one mode.
- *Correlation coefficient*. This number ranges from -1 to 1 and tells us two things about a linear relationship:
 - Direction: A positive coefficient means that higher values in one variable are associated with higher values in the other. A negative coefficient means higher values in one variable are associated with lower values of the other.
 - Strength: The farther the coefficient is from 0, the stronger the relationship and the more the points in a scatter plot look in a line.

 - Summary statistics give us measurements to describe our data.
 - Categorical values can be described with frequencies and proportions.
 - Sometimes we need robust statistics like the median and IQR because our data is skewed or has outliers.
 - Scatter plots and correlation coefficients help us describe linear relationships between pairs of numerics variables.
